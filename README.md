This repository was created to make the log of my research. The objective of this research is to build a lightfield video dataset that could explore some features of this kind of images and make images that could stress compress algorithms.
The images of this dataset are stored in: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pu6tKL4fNzvdCfkh_0K4HLOyjKKmzvTe?usp=sharing
